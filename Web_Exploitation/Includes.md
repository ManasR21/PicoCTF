---

## Solution Steps

### 1. Initial Website Interaction
- Visited the provided website.
- Clicked on the **"Say Hello"** button.
- An alert box appeared with the message:
  > "This code is in a separate file!"

This suggested that some functionality or hints might be hidden within external files.

### 2. Inspecting the Website's Source Code
- Opened the **Developer Tools** (right-click > Inspect).
- Navigated to the **Sources** tab to explore included files.

### 3. Discovering the Hidden Clues

- **`style.css`:**
  - Found a CSS file controlling the page style.
  - It also contained a hidden comment:
    ```css
    /*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
    ```

- **`script.js`:**
  - This JavaScript file controlled the alert functionality.
  - It also had a hidden comment:
    ```javascript
    //  f7w_2of2_6edef411}
    ```

### 4. Assembling the Flag
- Combining the two parts from the CSS and JS files gave the final flag:

```
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_6edef411}
```

---

## Tools Used
- **Browser Developer Tools** (Inspect Element, Sources tab).
- Manual inspection of CSS and JS files.

---

## Conclusion
This challenge demonstrated the importance of inspecting external files linked to a web page. Hidden comments in CSS or JS files can sometimes contain critical information like flags in CTF challenges.

Key takeaway: Always check **Sources** and **Network** tabs when exploring web-based challenges!
