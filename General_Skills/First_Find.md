cd "./adequate_books/more_books/.secret/deeper_secrets/deepest_secrets/"
```

I verified the file's presence with:

```bash
ls
```

**Output:**
```
uber-secret.txt
```

### 4. **Reading the File Contents**
Finally, I used the `cat` command to reveal the contents of the file:

```bash
cat uber-secret.txt
```
